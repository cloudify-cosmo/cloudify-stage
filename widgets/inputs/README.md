### Deployment Inputs

Presents the names and values of the inputs of a specific deployment. The deployment can be selected in one of the following ways: 

* By placing the deployment inputs widget in the deployments drill-down page, meaning the deployment has been selected before entering the page, and its id is included in the page’s context. 
* By adding to the page a widget allowing to select deployments, such as the resources filter or the blueprint deployments.  

If only a blueprint was selected, the widget will present the default values for the inputs, defined in the blueprint itself.
