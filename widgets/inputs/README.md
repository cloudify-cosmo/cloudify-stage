# Deployment Inputs

Presents the names and values of the inputs of the deployment currently set in the context.
See [notes](/working_with/console/widgets/index.html) for more information on resource context.  
If only a blueprint is set in the context, the widget will present the default values for the inputs, defined in the blueprint itself.
