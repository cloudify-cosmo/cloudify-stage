### Blueprint Action Buttons
Buttons that allow performing actions on a selected blueprint - creating a deployment from it, or deleting the blueprint. 
The action buttons need to receive the id of the desired blueprint. This can be accomplished in two ways: 

* By placing the buttons in a blueprint’s drill-down page, meaning the blueprint has been selected before entering the page, and its id is included in the page’s context. 
* By adding to the page a widget allowing to select blueprints, such as the resources filter or the blueprints list.
