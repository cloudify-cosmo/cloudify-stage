## Features

### Deployment basic information

The Deployments widget displays a list of deployments in the current tenant. The displayed information is: Deployment name,
the blueprint which the deployment is derived from, the deployments creation and last update dates,
the name of the user who created the deployment, and the number of node instances per state.


### Last execution status

You can also quickly check status and logs of the last workflow executed on the deployment by hovering over the status icon in the top left corner of deployment. Depending on the type of the execution there are additional action buttons there.

![Last Execution Status]( /images/ui/widgets/blueprint-deployments_last-execution-status.png )

The last execution status is indicated as follows:

* ![Failed Execution Icon]( /images/ui/icons/execution-failed-icon.png ) - **Failed** - execution has failed
* ![Execution In Progress Icon]( /images/ui/icons/execution-in-progress-icon.png ) - **In Progress** - execution is in progress (meaning that it is in one of the following states: pending, started, cancelling, force_cancelling, kill_cancelling)
* ![Cancelled Execution Icon]( /images/ui/icons/execution-cancelled-icon.png ) - **Cancelled** - execution has been cancelled
* ![Waiting Execution Icon]( /images/ui/icons/execution-waiting-icon.png ) - **Waiting** - execution has been either scheduled or queued and it is waiting
* ![Completed Execution Icon]( /images/ui/icons/execution-completed-icon.png ) - **Completed** - execution has been completed


### Node instances status

The status of the deployments' node instances is indicated as follows:

![Node Instance Statuses]( /images/ui/widgets/blueprint-deployments_node-statuses.png )

* **Blue** - the number of node instances that are not initialized
* **Yellow** - the number of node instances that are in active state (one of: initializing, creating, created, configuring, configured, starting, stopping, stopped and deleting)
* **Green** - the number of node instances that are started
* **Black** - the number of node instances that are deleted


### Executing an action

The hamburger menu (![list icon]( /images/ui/icons/list-icon.png )) 
on the right of every deployment allows performing the following operations:

* Install/Uninstall deployment
* Update deployment
* Set site for deployment
* Manage deployment labels
* Delete or Force Delete deployment

3. Select the inputs file for the blueprint or provide values for the inputs.
4. Set actions to be performed during the update or use defaults.  
5. Click **Update**.

#### Setting a Site

1. Click **Set Site** in the action menu.

You will also be able to track the progress of the execution as
at the bottom of the deployment row, there will be a thin line visible. 
Progress is calculated based on the number of execution operations finished.
Check [workflow execution model](/developer/execution_model) 
to get more details about workflows execution. 

![Deployment progress]( /images/ui/widgets/blueprint-deployments_progress-bar.png )

The color of the line indicates the status of the execution:

* **Green** - succeeded
* **Yellow** - in progress
* **Red** - failed


Each of the default workflows is described in detail [here](/working_with/workflows/built-in-workflows).
