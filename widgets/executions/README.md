By default, the presented details include the blueprint and deployment of the execution, name of the workflow, the time that it was created and ended, execution creator, execution attributes, its status and actions menu.

In **Attributes** column you can see one of these icons:

In the actions menu on the right side of the execution row (click ![List icon](https://docs.cloudify.co/staging/dev/images/ui/icons/list-icon.png) to open) you can perform additional actions on the execution:

* `Show Execution Parameters` - shows details in modal window about execution parameters,    
* `Show Update Details` - shows details in modal window about blueprint and inputs change (available only for 'update' executions),
* `Show Error Details` - shows error details in modal window (available only for failed executions), 
* `Resume` - resume the execution (available only for cancelled or failed executions)
* `Cancel` - cancels the execution (available only for active executions),
* `Force Cancel` - enforces cancellation of the execution (available only for active executions), 
* `Kill Cancel` - the process executing the workflow is forcefully stopped, even if it is stuck or unresponsive.
