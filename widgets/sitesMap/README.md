## Site markers

The color of the site marker on the map indicates the site's health. It is derived from the status of the deployments attached to the site.

After clicking the site marker on the map, the user is presented with a popup with the status breakdown of the deployments assigned with the site.

Site details contain information about deployments' statuses, indicated as follows:

* **Green** - the number of deployments with all nodes successfully started.
* **Yellow** - the number of deployments in which active workflow execution is performed.
* **Blue** - the number of deployments with non-started nodes.
* **Red** - the number of deployments with failed workflow execution.
