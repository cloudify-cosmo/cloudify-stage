Sometimes error logs may contain additional information about error cause. This will be indicated by ![error-cause-icon](https://docs.cloudify.co/staging/dev/images/ui/icons/error-cause-icon.png) icon in the Message column. When you click on this icon you will see detailed information about the error:
