## Settings

* `Refresh time interval` - The time interval in which the widgetâ€™s data will be refreshed, in seconds. Default: 10 seconds
* `Blueprint ID` - The blueprint ID must be passed to the widget. This can be done either setting blueprint in the context (see [notes](/working_with/console/widgets/index.html) for more information on resource context), or by specifying the blueprint ID in this configuration field. The blueprint ID is its name.
