#### Widget Settings
* `Refresh time interval` - The time interval in which the widget’s data will be refreshed, in seconds. Default: 10 seconds
* `Blueprint ID` - The blueprint ID must be passed to the widget. This can be done either by placing the widget in a blueprint’s drill-down page (in which case the blueprint ID is automatically passed in the page’s context), or by specifying the blueprint ID in this configuration field. The blueprint ID is its name.
