### Deployment Outputs

Presents the names and values of the outputs and capabilities of a specific deployment. The deployment can be selected in one of the following ways: 

* By placing the deployment outputs widget in the deployments drill-down page, meaning the deployment has been selected before entering the page, and its id is included in the page’s context. 
* By adding to the page a widget allowing to select deployments, such as the resources filter or the blueprint deployments.   

If only a blueprint was selected, the widget will present the default values for the outputs, defined in the blueprint itself.

Capabilities can be easily distinguished from the outputs in the table. They have the following label on the right side of the name:
