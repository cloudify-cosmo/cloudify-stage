The Cloudify Console provides User Interface for managing and analyzing [Cloudify Manager](https://cloudify.co).

## Requirements

The following requirements should be met prior starting the application:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version >= 10.15.x) installed
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (version >= 9.5.x) installed and configured:
    - Make a database named `stage` 
    - Make a user named `cloudify` with `cloudify` as password
    - You can do this easily with docker:
        ```bash
        docker pull postgres
        docker run --name postgres-cfy -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=cloudify -e POSTGRES_USER=cloudify -e POSTGRES_DB=stage -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
        ```
- Cloudify Manager (version >= 4.x) accessible from your local machine

## Setup

To setup development environment and start the application follow the steps below.

1. **Configuration**
   
   * Create `conf/me.json` file basing on `conf/me.json.template`.
   * Change `<MANAGER_IP>` into real IP of your Cloudify Manager in that file.

1. **Dependencies installation**

   Run `npm run beforebuild` to install install application dependencies.

1. **Database setup**
   
   Run `cd backend && npm run db-migrate` to initialize database.

1. **Application start**

   You can run the application by starting the stage backend server and starting [webpack dev server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) serving client side:
   * Run `cd backend && npm run devStart` to start backend server.
   * Run `npm run devServer` to start webpack dev server.

At this point you should have development environment configured and running. Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) page in your web-browser to see if application is running.

Changes in the source code shall be hot loaded to the development version of the application:
- for changes in [app](./app) directory you don't need to reload page, 
- for changes in [widgets](./widgets) directory you need to reload page to see your updates,
- for changes in [backend](./backend) directory you don't need to reload page as backend server will automatically be restarted.

## Deployment
You can create a package and deploy it on a remote Cloudify Manager server.

To do that follow these steps:

1. Create application package:
    - to create production build run: `npm run build`
    - to pack all necessary files into archive run: `npm run zip`
    Application package will be in repo main directory. 
1. Upload the package to the remote Cloudify Manager:
    - define path to private SSH key to access Cloudify Manager: `export SSH_KEY_PATH=<PATH>`
    - define Cloudify Manager IP adress: `export MANAGER_IP=<MANAGER_IP>`
    - upload package to the Cloudify Manager and restart UI services: `npm run upload`

Open browser and go to page `http://<MANAGER_IP>` to see if application is running.
