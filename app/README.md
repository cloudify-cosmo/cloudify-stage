## Running

To start development version of the frontend run `npm run devStart` in main folder.

## Debugging

By default logging level is set to `warning`. You can easily change it in the code or directly in the browser console:

```
log.setLevel(log.levels.DEBUG); 
```

For more details see [loglevel](https://github.com/pimterry/loglevel) package web page.
